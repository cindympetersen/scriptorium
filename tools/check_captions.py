"""check_captions.py — every figure a draft shows must carry a caption.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  The rule is the author's and it is a DEFAULT, not a preference (Eric, 2026-09-11:
  *"the figure should have a caption. (and this should be the default behavior)"*).
  It was written into `styles/essay/corrections.md` and into ALT-TEXT.md, and then
  it lived there — as prose. No tool read it.

  Measured 2026-09-14: *The Coordinates You Happen to Have* was drafted, critiqued,
  gated nine ways, cleared, composed and PUBLISHED TO ALL THREE OUTLETS with three
  of its four figures carrying no caption at all. Every gate was green the whole
  way, because none of them was looking. The author caught it, which is the same
  way the pronoun and britishism rules were caught before they had sweeps — and the
  lesson each time is the one this file exists to stop repeating: **a rule no sweep
  checks is a rule nobody enforces.**

  Alt text and a caption are two different jobs and neither substitutes for the
  other. The alt is what a reader who cannot see the picture gets; the caption is
  what the sighted skimmer gets, and it says what the figure MEANS rather than what
  it shows. A drafting pass that writes the alt and stops leaves the skimmer nothing.

WHAT IT CHECKS
  For every image referenced in draft.md as `![alt](path)`:
    - the hero (the manifest's `cover:`, or any `assets/hero.*`) must have
      `cover_caption:`
    - every other figure must have an entry under `captions:` keyed by the exact
      path the draft gives it
  It also reports a `captions:` key that no image in the draft uses, because that is
  a caption the reader will never see and usually means a path was renamed.

USAGE
  python3 check_captions.py <piece_dir> [<piece_dir> ...]
  python3 check_captions.py --all [--root .]

EXIT
  0  every figure has a caption
  1  usage
  3  at least one figure has none

    """The caption-bearing fields, read the way md_to_substack reads them.

    `images:` matters as much as `captions:`. A PUBLISHED piece references its hero by
    the uploaded CDN url rather than by `assets/hero.png`, so a checker that only knows
    local paths calls a captioned hero uncaptioned. The converter maps the url back
    through `images:` before looking up a caption, and so must this: a check that cries
    wolf on two thirds of the corpus is a check the next session switches off.

    Deliberately a small hand parser rather than a yaml import: this runs in CI,
    where the point is that the check cannot be the thing that breaks.
