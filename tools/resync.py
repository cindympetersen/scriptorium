"""resync.py — a correction is not shipped until EVERY outlet the piece declares has it.

WHY THIS EXISTS (Eric, 2026-09-14: *"our toolset should republish to all outlets. why was
this missed?"*).

  The answer was that the fan-out was PROSE. `substack_repatch.py` and `substack_sync.py`
  contain no occurrence of `outlets`, `md_to_site` or `store_publish` — they know one
  destination and cannot raise the existence of a second. The rule to carry a correction to
  the other outlets lived in one sentence of the `substack-sync` skill, which even cited the
  measured precedent: *For the Love of Dogs*, 2026-09-11, corrected on Substack while
  alignmentfellowship.org went on serving the old sentence "until an audit happened to look."

  So it had already happened once, been measured, and been written up — and it recurred on
  2026-09-14 anyway, on *In the Name (The Ambassador)*. That is the evidence that another
  paragraph of documentation was not the fix.

  THE ASYMMETRY IS THE HOLE. Publishing got a real preflight gate after a measured
  half-publish — `check_outlets.py` refuses a piece whose outlets cannot all be reached,
  precisely so the irreversible outlet is not the one you discover the problem after. The
  RE-SYNC path referenced it zero times, even though a correction is the one case where the
  outlets are GUARANTEED to disagree at the start.

WHAT IT DOES. Reads the piece's `outlets:`, resolves each outlet's reader URL, fetches it
  cache-busted, and asks whether the live page carries the paragraphs the desk now holds.
  Then it reports per outlet and REFUSES TO LOOK LIKE COMPLETION: the summary always reads
  "N of M outlets current", and the exit code is non-zero while any outlet is behind.

  That last part is the point. `substack_verify --fresh` printed "the repo matches the
  publication" and exited 0 on a piece declaring two outlets — a true sentence about one
  publication that reads as a finished job. A partial must be loud, not silent.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not write to any outlet. Carrying the change is still the
  outlet's own path — the browser for Substack, a bundle + store publish for a site, a person
  for LinkedIn — and this tool is what tells you which of those you still owe.

  The comparison is `outlet_audit.content_drift`: a PRESENCE check, borrowed rather than
  reimplemented. It can prove every paragraph the desk holds is on the page a reader gets.
  It cannot prove ordering, or that the page carries nothing extra. Said here because a
  checker that implies more than it proves is worse than none.

DEFERRAL IS BOUND TO THE DRAFT, or it is just a silent skip.

    resync.py <piece> --defer <outlet> --reason "a person posts this one"

  writes `resync_defer: {<outlet>: {reason, draft_sha, at}}` into publish.yaml. The deferral
  holds only while `draft.md` still hashes to `draft_sha`. Edit the draft and the deferral
  lapses back to BEHIND on its own — because a reason given for one version of a piece is not
  a reason for the next one, and a permanent exemption is how a gate gets switched off for good.

EXIT
  0  every declared outlet is current, or validly deferred
  2  an outlet could not be read — never wears the same face as a pass
  3  an outlet is behind, missing, or has no reader address recorded
