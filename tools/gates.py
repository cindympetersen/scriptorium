"""gates.py — run every mechanical check a piece has, in one command.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  The gates were a LIST IN PROSE, in `skills/review/SKILL.md`, and a list in prose is
  a list a reader can skim. Measured 2026-09-11: a review ran six of the eight gates,
  skipped `check_scripture.py`, and verified the piece's scripture against a website
  instead — while the desk held an indexed KJV and a tool that reads it. The review
  then reported "sources re-opened" in its artifact, which was true of the network and
  not of the repo. Nothing in the pipeline could tell the difference.

  So the fix is not another sentence in a skill file. It is one command that runs
  them all and one record of what it found. (Eric, 2026-09-11: *"anything we can fix
  in our repo to prevent *not* checking a local source?"*)

  `--json` writes the results into the piece's `review.json` under `gates`, so the
  review artifact's gate band REPORTS WHAT RAN rather than what the reviewer typed.
  A gate that was skipped cannot appear there as a pass.
