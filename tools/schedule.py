schedule.py — a piece can be finished and still not be due yet.

A piece is sealed on one day and meant to go live on another. Between those two days
there is nothing in the desk that knows the difference, and every tool that publishes
will happily publish. This is the thing that knows: one field in the manifest, one
moment, and a refusal before it.

  publish_at: 2026-09-15 09:00 America/New_York

Read it with `state()`, or from the command line:

  python3 tools/schedule.py check <piece>...     exit 4 while a piece is embargoed
  python3 tools/schedule.py list                 every piece that carries the field
  python3 tools/schedule.py due [--within 48h]   what opens inside the window (or has)
  python3 tools/schedule.py set <piece> "<moment>"
  python3 tools/schedule.py clear <piece>
  python3 tools/schedule.py runbook <piece>      the prompt a scheduled wake-up needs
  python3 tools/schedule.py arm <piece> --task … --does … --reviewed "<who, when>"
  python3 tools/schedule.py armed                what is armed across the desk
  python3 tools/schedule.py record <piece> --outlet … --where … --approved "<who, when>"

RECORD THE ACT, NOT ONLY THE INTENT. A native schedule lives on Substack's or LinkedIn's
side, where nothing here can see it — so a tool reading `publish_at` alone says "its own
scheduler has it for Tuesday" whether the schedule was set or forgotten. `record` writes
the act into the manifest (when, where, against what evidence, approved by whom), and
`outlet_audit` reads an outlet that is due with no record as NOT SCHEDULED.

THE ORDER IS NOT NEGOTIABLE: compose the drafts, let the author read them, THEN arm. A
scheduled publication fires with nobody watching, so the reading has to have happened
first (Eric, 2026-09-11: "we don't set the schedule until the drafts are reviewed and
approved"). `arm` refuses without `--reviewed`, and records who approved it.

WHAT IT GATES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.

  REFUSES   Anything that makes the piece public or queues it to become public:
            `md_to_site.py` will not export an embargoed piece into the store bundle
            (exit 12), which is what a site reads -- UNLESS that outlet is configured
            `on_schedule: immediate` (see OUTLETS below), in which case it exports and
            says so.

  WARNS     Composing. A Substack draft is private and a LinkedIn file is a file on
            this Mac; composing early is how a scheduled publication is prepared at
            all, so `md_to_substack.py` and `md_to_linkedin.py` print the embargo and
            carry on. The `publish` skill reads this tool before it clicks anything.

  KNOWS     Nothing about clocks. It compares a moment to now, and the refusal is the
            whole mechanism. Nothing here fires on its own, on purpose: an unattended
            publish is a decision the author makes explicitly elsewhere (for Substack,
            its own scheduler, set in the composer once the draft is ready).

WHY A TIMEZONE IS REQUIRED. "2026-09-15" is not a moment, it is a date in whatever zone
the reader happens to be in, and an embargo that opens at a different instant depending
on who asks is not an embargo. A moment with no zone is refused (exit 2) rather than
assumed. Write the zone you mean: `America/New_York` reads correctly across a DST
boundary, where a fixed `-04:00` quietly does not.

OUTLETS: THE MOMENT IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION FOR ALL OF THEM, AND THE REASON IS
EDITORIAL. One piece has one `publish_at:`, but the outlets it names do not all want to
wait for it. The quire websites are the CANONICAL publication and drive no traffic, so a
piece belongs there as soon as it is finished; the feed outlets -- Substack, LinkedIn --
are where regular publishing does work, and they wait for the moment (Eric, 2026-09-11:
"we should be able to configure an outlet for immediate publishing when scheduling ...
the websites (using quire) are the canonical publications and do not drive traffic").

So the policy is a property of the OUTLET, in the instance's registry:

  outlets:
    alignmentfellowship:
      on_schedule: immediate     # canonical: publishes as soon as the piece is ready
    substack:
      on_schedule: at_moment     # the default, and may be left unwritten

`outlet_policy()` reads it and FAILS CLOSED: a missing file, an unknown outlet, an
unreadable registry or an unrecognised value all answer `at_moment`. The safe direction
is refusing to publish, so nothing about a typo or an absent PyYAML can turn an embargo
off. An exemption also has to be SAID -- `embargo_note()` is what a caller prints --
because a piece published before its moment with nothing on the terminal is
indistinguishable from a piece that never had an embargo at all.

Exit codes: 0 open (or no field) · 1 usage · 2 a malformed or zoneless moment ·
4 at least one piece is still embargoed.
